Why are Java strings immutable?
Ans=>what string immutability means here is that, yes you can
    change the value that a string variable is holding, but what
    that essentially does is changes where that variable is pointing.
    This helps so that in case 2 strijng variables are have to store the same value, they can just point to the same point in the string pool, thus saving space.
